      Hi everyone! I'm Joshua McCluskey, and I live in Seattle. I've grown up all over, but I call Wisconsin home. My family has an organic dairy farm back in Wisconsin, and they make cheese. I graduated from "the other UW" --the University of Wisconsin-- focusing on foreign languages and Asian humanities. Post UW, I spent most my time as an Airborne Cryptologic Linguist in the U.S. Air Force, flying and learning languages. While working as a federal contracting specialist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, my obsession with coding grew after I built a workflow system and a data analysis system for my office. Recently, I decided to pursue coding full time. My biggest goal right now is to learn as much as I can to become a Software Developer.
